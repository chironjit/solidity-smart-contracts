# solidity-smart-contracts
This repository is a showcase of smart contracts I have worked on and have deployed. Depending on the original projects, these contracts may have been deployed to Ethereum, Polygon and/or Avalanche.

Contracts may include supporting smart contracts that are taken from libraries such as Openzeppelin and ERC721A. 

Contracts should be deployable in its current state, except where supporting smart contracts have not been included (generally for example things like base ERC721 contract) or where certain data have been removed (for example hardcoded addresses, strings, etc).

WARNING: All contracts in this repository have customisations, even where most of the code may look similar to those from the common standards. A lot of these customisations have to do with handling of funds. Do not use without first verifying the code does what you intend it to do.
